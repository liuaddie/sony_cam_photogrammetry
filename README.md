# vfx_cams
Aimed to create a set of tools to control multiple cameras to help VFX workflow, start with photogrammetry, maybe bullet time later. I got some of Sony NEX cameras, and Sony has API to control them, so I started from them.

This is rush personal project originally, moved from private repo to public and looking for anyone (VFX Artist, Developer, Designer, Engineer & Everyone) would like to join the development, welcome for comments, create issues, fork, pull request & others.

This Project is logging in https://hackaday.io/project/189006

Work In Progress: Rewrite all code, Redesign the UI.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend
- Two side of backend, controller and server side
- Controller side is running on SBC (Orange pi Zero 2) to control the camera by Sony Camera Remote API (https://developer.sony.com/develop/cameras/)
- For 30 cameras, there will be 30 controller run on 30 SBC
- Server side is running on any computer by sending command to all Controllers
- Both controller and server side: Running python flask to handle POST JSON command from control panal UI(frontend)
- pysony (https://github.com/Bloodevil/sony_camera_api) is used to handle Sony's API

## üé® Frontend
- Bootstrap is used for UI layout
- Jquery is used for handle button actions
- Jinja format templates for flask in python
