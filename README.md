# sony_cam_photogrammetry
Aimed to create a set of tools to control multiple cameras to help VFX workflow, start with photogrammetry, maybe bullet time later. I got some of Sony NEX cameras, and Sony has API to control them, so I started from them.

This is rush personal project originally, moved from private repo to public and looking for anyone (VFX Artist, Developer, Designer, Engineer & Everyone) would like to join the development, welcome for comments, create issues, fork, pull request & others.

Work In Progress: Rewrite all code, Redesign the UI, Credit every module I used or referenced and write a better README of course.
